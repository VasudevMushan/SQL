# SQL Analysis Project

This project demonstrates using SQL to solve complex queries in an airline database (airline DB). It covers a range of tasks involving the retrieval, manipulation, and analysis of airline-related data such as flight schedules, passenger details, booking information, and aircraft details. The goal of this project is to strengthen SQL querying skills and apply them to real-world airline data problems.

-Project Overview In this project, I worked with an airline database to: Retrieve and format data from various tables including flights, bookings, tickets, passengers, and aircraft. Write SQL queries to answer specific questions about flight operations, seat allocations, and passenger activity. Use joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregates to gather insights from the data.

-Key Tasks Formatting date fields, extracting and aggregating data. Identifying the most and least active passengers by the total amount spent. Finding details of specific flight operations such as non-stop journeys, return flights, and morning flights. Analyzing seat allocations, aircraft usage, and flight cancellations. Reporting on flight operations such as longest flights, earliest flights, and flights with the highest range. Providing insights into customer refunds due to flight cancellations.

-Techniques Used Joins: Combining data from multiple tables to extract meaningful results. Window Functions: Ranking and partitioning data to analyze passengers, flights, and seats. Aggregations: Summing, counting, and averaging data to answer complex questions. Subqueries: Using nested queries to refine data extraction and solve advanced problems.

-Project Outcomes Gained hands-on experience working with relational databases in a real-world airline scenario. Applied various SQL techniques to solve practical data problems. Delivered clear, optimized SQL queries to generate required reports and insights.
